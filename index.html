            <h3>The story</h3>
            <p id="firstParagraph">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.</p>
            <p>They said,</p>
            <p class="neighbors"> “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</p>
            <p>The farmer said,</p> 
            <p class="farmer">“Maybe.”</p>
            <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,</p> 
            <p class="neighbors">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</p>
            <p>The farmer again said,</p>
            <p class="farmer">“Maybe.”</p>
            <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,</p> 
            <p class="neighbors">“Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span> ?,”</p>
            <p>and the farmer responded,</p>  
            <p class="farmer">“Maybe.”</p> 
            <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected
                his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,</p> 
            <p class="neighbors">“Isn’t that great!"</p>
            <p>Again, he said,</p>  
            <p class="farmer">“Maybe.”</p> 
            <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything 
                that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> ? — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what 
                will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                <blockquote><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad ?</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas.
